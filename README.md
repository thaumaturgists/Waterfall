# Project Title: Dynamic Clock and Background Changer

## Description
This project is a simple web application that displays a dynamic clock and allows users to change the background of the page with a button click. The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and incorporates various web security best practices to ensure a safe browsing experience.

## Features
- **Dynamic Clock**: Displays the current time and updates every second.
- **Background Change**: Users can change the background image of the page by clicking a button.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout is designed to be responsive and works well on various screen sizes.
- **Security Measures**: Implements Content Security Policy (CSP), Subresource Integrity (SRI), and other security headers to protect against common web vulnerabilities.

## Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
- Web Security Best Practices

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.)
- Basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/thaumaturgists/Waterfall.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Waterfall
   ```
3. Open `index.html` in your web browser.

### Usage
- Upon loading the page, you will see a greeting message and a clock displaying the current time.
- Click the "Change Background" button to change the background image of the page.

## Security Considerations
This project follows best practices for web security, including:
- **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Restricts the sources from which content can be loaded.
- **Subresource Integrity (SRI)**: Ensures that external scripts are delivered without unexpected manipulation.
- **Strict Transport Security (HSTS)**: Enforces the use of HTTPS to protect data in transit.
- **Input Validation**: Ensures that any user input is properly validated and sanitized.

## Future Enhancements
- Add more background images to choose from.
- Implement user preferences to save the selected background.
- Enhance the clock display with additional features (e.g., date, time zones).
