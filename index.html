X-Frame-Options Header
The X-Frame-Options HTTP header is used to control whether a browser should be allowed to render a page in a <frame>, <iframe>, <embed>, or <object>. This is primarily used to prevent clickjacking attacks.

The X-Frame-Options header can take one of three values:
- DENY: The page cannot be displayed in a frame, regardless of the site attempting to do so.
- SAMEORIGIN: The page can only be displayed in a frame on the same origin as the page itself.
- ALLOW-FROM uri: The page can only be displayed in a frame on the specified origin. (Note: This value is not supported in all browsers.)
-->

<!-- Example of setting the X-Frame-Options header in an HTTP response
<!-- This should be done in your server configuration, not in HTML
1. **Apache**:
   ```apache
   Header set X-Frame-Options "DENY"
   ```
2. **Nginx**:
   ```nginx
   add_header X-Frame-Options "DENY";
   ```
3. **Node.js/Express**:
   ```javascript
   res.setHeader('X-Frame-Options', 'DENY');
   ```
4. **Django**:
   ```python
   from django.views.decorators.http import require_http_methods
   from django.http import HttpResponse

   @require_http_methods(["GET"])
   def my_view(request):
       response = HttpResponse("Hello, World!")
       response['X-Frame-Options'] = 'DENY'
       return response
   ``` -->

    <!-- Limit HTTP Methods:
    Configure your server to only allow necessary HTTP methods (e.g., GET, POST) and disable others (e.g., PUT, DELETE) if not needed. -->

    <!-- Security Headers:
    Consider adding additional security headers such as X-XSS-Protection, Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only, and Referrer-Policy for more granular control. -->
    <!-- X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
    The X-XSS-Protection header is a security feature used to help prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks in web applications, and is not placed directly in the HTML document itself; instead, it is set in the HTTP response headers sent by the web server.

    Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only:
    This header allows you to test your Content Security Policy (CSP) without enforcing it. It reports violations to a specified URI, which can help you identify potential security issues without breaking your site.

    Referrer-Policy:
    This header controls how much referrer information is passed when navigating from your site to another. It can help protect user privacy. -->

    <!-- Monitoring and Logging:
    Implement logging and monitoring to detect and respond to suspicious activities. -->

    <!-- Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS):
    If your application makes cross-origin requests, configure CORS headers on your server to restrict which domains can access your resources. -->

    <!-- Input Validation and Output Encoding:
    Implement strict input validation on the server side to prevent injection attacks (SQL injection, XSS, etc.).
    Use output encoding to ensure that any user-generated content is safely displayed in the browser. -->

    <!-- Rate Limiting and Throttling:
    Implement rate limiting on your APIs to prevent abuse and brute-force attacks. -->
